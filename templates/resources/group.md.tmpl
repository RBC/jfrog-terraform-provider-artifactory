# Artifactory Group Resource

Provides an Artifactory group resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory groups.

## Example Usage

{{tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name) }}

## Argument reference

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

{{- if .HasImport }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}

{{- end }}

~> `users_names` can't be imported due to API limitations.

## Managed vs Unmanaged Group Membership

Terraform does not distinguish between an absent `users_names` attribute and setting to an empty array (i.e. length of 0).

To prevent accidental deletion of existing membership, the default was chosen to mean that Terraform does not manage membership and that to detach all users would require an explicit bool.

~>When moving from managed group membership to unmanaged the Terraform plan will show the users previously in the array
being removed from terraform state, but it will not actually delete any members (unless `detach_all_users` is set to `true`).

Also see [our recommendation](guides/user_group.md) on how to manage user-group relationship.
