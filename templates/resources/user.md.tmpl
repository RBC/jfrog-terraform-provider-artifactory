# Artifactory User Resource

Provides an Artifactory user resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory users.
The password is a required field by the [Artifactory API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-CreateorReplaceUser), but we made it optional in this resource to accommodate the scenario where the password is not needed and will be reset by the actual user later.  
When the optional attribute `password` is omitted, a random password is generated according to current Artifactory password policy.

~> The generated password won't be stored in the TF state and can not be recovered. The user must reset the password to be able to log in. An admin can always generate the access key for the user as well. The password change won't trigger state drift. We don't recommend to use this resource unless there is a specific use case for it. Recommended resource is `artifactory_managed_user`.

## Example Usage

{{tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name) }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
