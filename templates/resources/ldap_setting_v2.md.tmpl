# Artifactory Ldap Setting v2 Resource

Provides an Artifactory LDAP Setting resource. 

This resource can be used to manage Artifactory's LDAP settings for user authentication.

When specified LDAP setting is active, Artifactory first attempts to authenticate the user against the LDAP server.
If LDAP authentication fails, it then tries to authenticate via its internal database.

~>The `artifactory_ldap_setting_v2` resource utilizes endpoints which are blocked/removed in SaaS environments (i.e. in Artifactory online), rendering this resource incompatible with Artifactory SaaS environments.

## Example Usage

{{tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name) }}

## Argument reference

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

{{- if .HasImport }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}

{{- end }}
