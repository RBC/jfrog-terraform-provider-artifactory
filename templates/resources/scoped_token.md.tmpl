# Artifactory Scoped Token Resource

Provides an Artifactory Scoped Token resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory Scoped Tokens.

!>Scoped Tokens will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in
state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

~>Token would not be saved by Artifactory if `expires_in` is less than the persistency threshold value (default to 10800 seconds) set in Access configuration. See [Persistency Threshold](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-platform-administration-documentation/using-the-revocable-and-persistency-thresholds) for details.

## Example Usages
