# Artifactory Remote Docker Repository Data Source

Retrieves a remote Docker repository.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "artifactory_remote_docker_repository" "remote-docker" {
  key = "remote-docker"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following argument is supported:

* `key` - (Required) the identity key of the repo.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are supported, along with the [common list of attributes for the remote repositories](../resources/remote.md):

* `block_pushing_schema1` - (Optional) When set, Artifactory will block the pulling of Docker images with manifest v2 schema 1 from the remote repository (i.e. the upstream). It will be possible to pull images with manifest v2 schema 1 that exist in the cache.
* `enable_token_authentication` - (Optional) Enable token (Bearer) based authentication.
* `external_dependencies_enabled` - (Optional) Also known as 'Foreign Layers Caching' on the UI.
* `external_dependencies_patterns` - (Optional) An allow list of Ant-style path patterns that determine which remote VCS roots Artifactory will follow to download remote modules from, when presented with 'go-import' meta tags in the remote repository response. By default, this is set to `[**]` in the UI, which means that remote modules may be downloaded from any external VCS source. Due to SDKv2 limitations, we can't set the default value for the list. This value `[**]` must be assigned to the attribute manually, if user don't specify any other non-default values. We don't want to make this attribute required, but it must be set to avoid the state drift on update. Note: Artifactory assigns `[**]` on update if HCL doesn't have the attribute set or the list is empty.
* `disable_url_normalization` - (Optional) Whether to disable URL normalization.
