# artifactory_release_bundle_v2 (Resource)

This resource enables you to creates a new Release Bundle v2, uniquely identified by a combination of repository key, name, and version. For more information, see [Understanding Release Bundles v2](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/understanding-release-bundles-v2) and [REST API](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/create-release-bundle-v2-version).

## Example Usage

```terraform

  name = "my-release-bundle-v2-aql"
  version = "1.0.0"
  keypair_name = "my-keypair-name"
  project_key = "myproj-key"
  skip_docker_manifest_resolution = true
  source_type = "aql"

  source = {
    aql = "items.find({\"repo\": {\"$match\": \"my-generic-*\"}})"
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `keypair_name` (String) Key-pair name to use for signature creation
- `name` (String) Name of Release Bundle
- `source` (Attributes) Defines specific repositories to include in the promotion. If this property is left undefined, all repositories (except those specifically excluded) are included in the promotion. Important: If one or more repositories are specifically included, all other repositories are excluded (regardless of what is defined in `excluded_repository_keys`). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source))
- `source_type` (String) Source type. Valid values: `aql`, `artifacts`, `builds`, `release_bundles`
- `version` (String) Version to promote

### Optional

- `project_key` (String) Project key the Release Bundle belongs to
- `skip_docker_manifest_resolution` (Boolean) Determines whether to skip the resolution of the Docker manifest, which adds the image layers to the Release Bundle. The default value is `false` (the manifest is resolved and image layers are included).

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) Timestamp when the new version was created (ISO 8601 standard).
- `created_by` (String) The user who created the Release Bundle.
- `service_id` (String) The unique identifier of the Artifactory instance where the Release Bundle was created.

<a id="nestedatt--source"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source`

Optional:

- `aql` (String) The contents of the AQL query.
- `artifacts` (Attributes Set) Source type to create a Release Bundle v2 version by collecting source artifacts from a list of path/checksum pairs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source--artifacts))
- `builds` (Attributes Set) Source type to create a Release Bundle v2 version by collecting source artifacts from one or multiple builds (also known as build-info). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source--builds))
- `release_bundles` (Attributes Set) Source type to create a Release Bundle v2 version by collecting source artifacts from existing Release Bundle versions. Must match `source_type` attribute value. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source--release_bundles))

<a id="nestedatt--source--artifacts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source.artifacts`

Required:

- `path` (String) The path for the artifact

Optional:

- `sha256` (String) The SHA256 for the artifact


<a id="nestedatt--source--builds"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source.builds`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the build.
- `number` (String) Number (run) of the build.

Optional:

- `include_dependencies` (Boolean) Determines whether to include build dependencies in the Release Bundle. The default value is `false`.

~>Dependencies must be located in local or Federated repositories to be included in the Release Bundle. Dependencies located in remote repositories are not supported.
- `repository` (String) The repository key of the build. If omitted, the system uses the default built-in repository, `artifactory-build-info`.
- `started` (String) Timestamp when the build was created. If omitted, the system uses the latest build run, as identified by the `name` and `number` combination. The timestamp is provided according to the ISO 8601 standard.


<a id="nestedatt--source--release_bundles"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source.release_bundles`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the release bundle.
- `version` (String) The version of the release bundle.

Optional:

- `project_key` (String) Project key of the release bundle.
- `repository_key` (String) The key of the release bundle repository.
