# Artifactory Unmanaged User Resource

Provides an Artifactory unmanaged user resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory users.
The password is a required field by the [Artifactory API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-CreateorReplaceUser), but we made it optional in this resource to accommodate the scenario where the password is not needed and will be reset by the actual user later.  
When the optional attribute `password` is omitted, a random password is generated according to current Artifactory password policy.

~> The generated password won't be stored in the TF state and can not be recovered. The user must reset the password to be able to log in. An admin can always generate the access key for the user as well. The password change won't trigger state drift.

~> This resource is an alias for `artifactory_user` [resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/artifactory/latest/docs/resources/user), it is identical and was added for clarity and compatibility purposes. We don't recommend to use this resource unless there is a specific use case for it. Recommended resource is `artifactory_managed_user`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new Artifactory user called terraform
resource "artifactory_unmanaged_user" "test-user" {
  name     = "terraform"
  email    = "test-user@artifactory-terraform.com"
  groups   = ["logged-in-users", "readers"]
  password = "my super secret password"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Username for user. May contain lowercase letters, numbers and symbols: '.-_@'
* `email` - (Required) Email for user.
* `password` - (Optional) Password for the user. When omitted, a random password is generated using the following password policy: 12 characters with 1 digit, 1 symbol, with upper and lower case letters.
* `admin` - (Optional) When enabled, this user is an administrator with all the ensuing privileges. Default value is `false`.
* `profile_updatable` - (Optional) When set, this user can update his profile details (except for the password. Only an administrator can update the password). Default value is `true`.
* `disable_ui_access` - (Optional) When set, this user can only access Artifactory through the REST API. This option cannot be set if the user has Admin privileges. Default value is `true`.
* `internal_password_disabled` - (Optional) When set, disables the fallback of using an internal password when external authentication (such as LDAP) is enabled.
* `groups` - (Optional) List of groups this user is a part of. **Notes:** If this attribute is not specified then user's group membership is set to empty. User will not be part of default "readers" group automatically.

## Import

Users can be imported using their name, e.g.

```
$ terraform import artifactory_unmanaged_user.test-user myusername
```
