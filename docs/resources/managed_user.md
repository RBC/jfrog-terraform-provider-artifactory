# Artifactory Managed User Resource

Provides an Artifactory managed user resource. This can be used to create and maintain Artifactory users. For example, service account where password is known and managed externally.

Unlike `artifactory_unmanaged_user` and `artifactory_user`, the `password` attribute is required and cannot be empty.
Consider using a separate provider to generate and manage passwords.

~> The password is stored in the Terraform state file. Make sure you secure it, please refer to the official [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "artifactory_managed_user" "test-user" {
  name     = "terraform"
  password = "my super secret password"
  email    = "test-user@artifactory-terraform.com"
  groups   = [ "readers", "logged-in-users"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) Email for user.
- `name` (String) Username for user. May contain lowercase letters, numbers and symbols: '.-_@'

### Optional

- `admin` (Boolean) (Optional, Default: false) When enabled, this user is an administrator with all the ensuing privileges.
- `disable_ui_access` (Boolean) (Optional, Default: true) When enabled, this user can only access the system through the REST API. This option cannot be set if the user has Admin privileges.
- `groups` (Set of String) List of groups this user is a part of. If no groups set, `readers` group will be added by default. If other groups are assigned, `readers` must be added to the list manually to avoid state drift.
- `internal_password_disabled` (Boolean) (Optional, Default: false) When enabled, disables the fallback mechanism for using an internal password when external authentication (such as LDAP) is enabled.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) (Optional, Sensitive) Password for the user. When omitted, a random password is generated using the following password policy: 12 characters with 1 digit, 1 symbol, with upper and lower case letters
- `profile_updatable` (Boolean) (Optional, Default: true) When enabled, this user can update their profile details (except for the password. Only an administrator can update the password). There may be cases in which you want to leave this unset to prevent users from updating their profile. For example, a departmental user with a single password shared between all department members.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import artifactory_managed_user.test-user myusername
```
