# Artifactory Anonymous User Resource

Provides an Artifactory anonymous user resource. This can be used to import Artifactory 'anonymous' user for some use cases where this is useful.

This resource is not intended for managing the 'anonymous' user in Artifactory. Use the `artifactory_user` resource instead.

!> Anonymous user cannot be created from scratch, nor updated/deleted once imported into Terraform state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Define a new Artifactory 'anonymous' user for import
resource "artifactory_anonymous_user" "anonymous" {
}
```

## Argument reference

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

### Optional

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import artifactory_anonymous_user.anonymous-user anonymous
```
